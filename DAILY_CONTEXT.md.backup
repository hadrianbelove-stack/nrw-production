## AI Assistant Quick Start

**READ THESE FILES FIRST WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:**

1. **This file (DAILY_CONTEXT.md)** - Current state, recent changes, active issues
2. **[PROJECT_CHARTER.md](PROJECT_CHARTER.md)** - Governance rules, amendments, API keys, architectural decisions
3. **[NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md](NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md)** - Data pipeline mechanics, how everything fits together

**What is this rolling context system?**

This is a **living document** that gets overwritten each session with current information. At the end of each session, we archive it to  (immutable historical record). This approach:
- **Avoids token waste** from loading months of PROJECT_LOG.md history
- **Provides fresh context** without stale information
- **Maintains audit trail** in the diary/ folder
- **Reduces AI confusion** by keeping focus on current state

See [AMENDMENT-036](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-036-rolling-daily-context) and [AMENDMENT-037](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-037-daily-context-system-three-file-loading-pattern) for governance rules.

## Archive Instructions

**End-of-session workflow:**

1. **Run archive script:** `./scripts/archive_daily_context.sh`
   - Archives current context to `diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (immutable historical record)
   - Creates fresh DAILY_CONTEXT.md template for next session
   - Automatically uses UTC date for consistency

2. **Preview changes (dry-run):** `./scripts/archive_daily_context.sh --dry-run`
   - Shows what would happen without executing
   - Useful for verifying before archiving

3. **Force overwrite existing archive:** `./scripts/archive_daily_context.sh --force`
   - Use when archive already exists for today
   - Overwrites existing diary entry (use with caution)

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - **Permission error:** Run `chmod +x scripts/archive_daily_context.sh`
   - **Missing file error:** Ensure you're in repository root directory
   - **Directory issues:** Script creates `diary/` automatically if missing

5. **Next session starts fresh:**
   - AI assistants read new DAILY_CONTEXT.md template
   - Historical context available in `diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if needed
   - No token waste from loading stale information

====================================

🔍 Step 0: Checking dependencies...
   ✅ All dependencies available

📥 Step 1: Pulling latest data from automation...
   ✅ Data is current

📊 Step 2: Quick Status Report

📋 Step 3: Context Files for AI Assistants
   When working with AI assistants, read these files in order:
   1. DAILY_CONTEXT.md (current state, recent changes, active issues) ⭐ PRIMARY
   2. PROJECT_CHARTER.md (governance & amendments)
   3. NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md (technical pipeline)

🚀 Step 4: Starting local server...
   ⚠️ Port 8000 in use, trying 8001...
   ❌ Ports 8000 and 8001 both in use. Stop other servers first.
   Try: lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill

### Manual Pipeline (if needed)
❌ DEPRECATED: movie_tracker.py is no longer supported

The movie tracking functionality has been integrated into the production discovery system.
Please use the following commands instead:

  For daily discovery:
    python3 generate_data.py --discover

  For full data generation:
    python3 generate_data.py

  For the complete daily pipeline:
    python3 daily_orchestrator.py

The legacy implementation is available at:
    museum_legacy/legacy_movie_tracker.py
