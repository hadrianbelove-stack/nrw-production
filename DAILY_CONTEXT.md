## AI Assistant Quick Start

**READ THESE FILES FIRST WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:**

1. **This file (DAILY_CONTEXT.md)** - Current state, recent changes, active issues
2. **[PROJECT_CHARTER.md](PROJECT_CHARTER.md)** - Governance rules, amendments, API keys, architectural decisions
3. **[NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md](NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md)** - Data pipeline mechanics, how everything fits together

**What is this rolling context system?**

This is a **living document** that gets overwritten each session with current information. At the end of each session, we archive it to `diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (immutable historical record). This approach:
- **Avoids token waste** from loading months of PROJECT_LOG.md history
- **Provides fresh context** without stale information
- **Maintains audit trail** in the diary/ folder
- **Reduces AI confusion** by keeping focus on current state

See [AMENDMENT-036](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-036-rolling-daily-context) and [AMENDMENT-037](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-037-daily-context-system-three-file-loading-pattern) for governance rules.

## What We Did Today (2025-10-20)

### Manual Pipeline Testing Phase (Oct 20)

**Purpose:** Verify complete NRW data pipeline functionality before relying on GitHub Actions automation

**Test Scope:**
- Phase 1: Discovery & Monitoring (`movie_tracker.py daily`)
- Phase 2: Data Enrichment (`generate_data.py`)
- Phase 3: Quality Validation (`ops/health_check.py` + manual inspection)
- Phase 4: Admin Panel Testing (`admin.py` on port 5555)
- Phase 5: Complete Pipeline (`daily_orchestrator.py`)

**Test Artifacts Created:**
- `TEST_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive manual testing checklist with verification steps
- `PIPELINE_TEST_REPORT.md` - Test report template for documenting findings

**Validation Criteria (from daily_orchestrator.py lines 92-138):**
- Minimum 200 movies in data.json
- At least 1 movie from last 7 days (ensures discovery working)
- Required fields present: title, digital_date, poster
- Watch links coverage check
- RT scores coverage check

**Configuration Verified:**
- Agent scraper: DISABLED (config.yaml line 21: `enabled: false`)
- RT scraper: ENABLED (config.yaml line 35: `enabled: true`)
- Display window: 90 days (config.yaml line 7)
- Admin credentials: admin/changeme (per NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md)

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual execution of each pipeline component
- Detailed observation and documentation of behavior
- Verification against expected outcomes
- Identification of any failures or warnings
- Performance measurement (execution times)

**Files Referenced:**
- `movie_tracker.py` - Discovery and monitoring (292 lines)
- `generate_data.py` - Data enrichment (1578 lines)
- `daily_orchestrator.py` - Pipeline coordinator with validation (316 lines)
- `ops/health_check.py` - System health validator (140 lines)
- `admin.py` - QA panel on port 5555 (1195 lines)
- `config.yaml` - Configuration settings
- `data.json` - Current display data (239 movies)
- `movie_tracking.json` - Master tracking database

### Agent Scraper Testing & Diagnostics (Oct 20)

**Purpose:** Verify agent scraper functionality and diagnose 100% failure rate

**Testing Performed:**
1. Created missing `.gitkeep` files for cache directories
2. Ran standalone agent scraper test (`test_agent_scraper.py`)
3. Analyzed 67 existing cache entries (all failures from Oct 17-19)
4. Reviewed screenshot diagnostics (HTML snapshots showing login walls)
5. Ran full regeneration with debug mode
6. Verified data.json has no Netflix/Disney+/Hulu links

**Key Findings:**
- **Root cause:** Authentication barriers on all streaming platforms
- **Evidence:** Screenshots show login prompts instead of search results
- **CSS selectors:** Correct but can't match elements behind login walls
- **Cache:** 71 entries, 100% failure rate, all have `"success": false`
- **Impact:** No direct streaming links for Netflix/Disney+/Hulu/HBO Max in data.json

**Infrastructure Status:**
- ✅ Playwright integration working (browser launches, pages load)
- ✅ Retry logic working (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ Diagnostics working (screenshots + HTML capture on failures)
- ✅ Caching working (30-day TTL, auto-expiration)
- ❌ Link finding failing (authentication required to see search results)

**Decision:** Keep agent scraper disabled
- Configuration: `config.yaml` line 21 (`enabled: false`)
- Rationale: Authentication barriers are a fundamental limitation, not a bug
- Alternative: Rely on Watchmode API + admin panel manual overrides
- Documentation: Created `AGENT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md` with full analysis

## Conversation Context (Key Decisions)

[Fill in during session - record important decisions and their rationale]

---

## Known Issues

### Issue: Agent Scraper Authentication Barriers (CONFIRMED - Oct 20)
- **Status:** ✅ Diagnosed and documented
- **Root cause:** Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max require login to view search results
- **Evidence:** 71 failed scraping attempts, screenshots show login walls, manual testing confirms
- **Impact:** No direct streaming links for these platforms in data.json
- **Mitigation:** Watchmode API provides rent/buy links; admin panel allows manual overrides for critical movies
- **Decision:** Keep agent scraper disabled (config.yaml line 21: `enabled: false`)
- **Documentation:** See `AGENT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md` for comprehensive analysis
- **Future:** Monitor if platforms add public APIs or change authentication requirements

---

## Next Priorities

### Completed (Oct 20)
- ✅ Diagnosed agent scraper authentication barriers
- ✅ Created comprehensive test report (AGENT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md)
- ✅ Confirmed agent scraper should remain disabled
- ✅ Created cache/.gitkeep and cache/screenshots/.gitkeep files
- ✅ Verified data.json has no direct Netflix/Disney+/Hulu links (uses Google search fallbacks)
- ✅ Analyzed cache with 71 entries showing 100% failure rate
- ✅ Updated config.yaml comment to reference test report
- ✅ Documented findings in diary and DAILY_CONTEXT.md

### Immediate (This Session)
- ⏳ Execute manual pipeline test following TEST_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- ⏳ Document findings in PIPELINE_TEST_REPORT.md
- ⏳ Verify data quality meets validation thresholds
- ⏳ Test admin panel authentication and inline editing
- ⏳ Identify any blocking issues before automation

### Next Phase
- ⏳ Review test report and address any critical issues
- ⏳ Verify GitHub Actions workflows are ready for first automated run
- ⏳ Monitor first automated daily update (9 AM UTC)
- ⏳ Test sync_daily_updates.sh to merge automation-updates branch

## Archive Instructions

**End-of-session workflow (automated via `ops/archive_daily_context.sh`):**

1. Run archive script: `./ops/archive_daily_context.sh`
   - Archives current context to `diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Creates fresh template for next session
   - Use `--dry-run` to preview changes without executing

2. **Testing:** `./ops/archive_daily_context.sh --dry-run` shows what would happen

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Permission error: `chmod +x ops/archive_daily_context.sh`
   - Missing file error: Ensure you're in repo root
   - Directory issues: Script creates `diary/` automatically

4. **Next session starts fresh:**
   - AI reads new DAILY_CONTEXT.md template
   - Historical context available in `diary/` if needed
   - No token waste from stale information

**Current status:** Archive script created and ready to use
