# AMENDMENT-ROADMAP-MVP-2025-09-04

This addendum locks the MVP restart plan:
- Render: client-only for MVP. Prebuild considered later.
- Digital date: first-seen provider as primary; API fills for poster/cast/runtime.
- Working Set: prototype.html, assets/nrw_styles.css, assets/nrw_render.js, data.json,
  PROJECT_CHARTER.md, PROJECT_LOG.md, complete_project_context.md, ALLCODE.md.
- Continuity: flat handoff each session with validation note.
- Click-through: default Amazon; override to service page when identified (Netflix, MUBI, etc.).
- Governance: number steps, declare run-semantics, keep a PASS/FAIL note per session.

Rationale: smallest surface to fight drift while shipping a usable wall and Substack export.
