# Git Commit Strategy - Admin Panel Redesign Session
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Session:** Oct 19-20 Admin Panel Redesign + Oct 21-22 Discovery Testing

---

## Current Git State (from Agent Analysis)

**Branch Status:**
- Current branch: `main`
- HEAD commit: `73c6eef342cd668d4238e987b05f310b589e723a`
- Last commit message: "Daily automation: Add 15 new movies (Oct 20–22)"
- origin/main: `73c6eef342cd668d4238e987b05f310b589e723a` (SAME as local)

**Divergence Analysis:**
- Commits ahead of origin/main: **0**
- Commits behind origin/main: **0**
- **Status: IN SYNC** ✅

**Merge/Rebase Required:** ❌ NO - Local and remote are at the same commit

**Branches:**
- Local: `main`, `automation-updates`
- Remote: `origin/main`, `origin/automation-updates`

---

## ⚠️ REQUIRED: Run Git Status First

**Before proceeding, run these commands to see actual uncommitted changes:**

```bash
cd /Users/hadrianbelove/Downloads/nrw-production

# Check what's uncommitted
git status

# See modified files (machine-readable)
git status --porcelain

# See diff summary
git diff --stat

# See staged files
git diff --name-only --cached

# List untracked files
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

**Why this is critical:**
- Agent cannot determine uncommitted files without running git commands
- User listed files to stage, but actual uncommitted files may differ
- Need to verify no unexpected changes are included
- Need to check for backup files (*.backup.*) that should NOT be committed

---

## Files to EXCLUDE from Commit

**DO NOT commit these files (verify with git status):**

1. **Discovery test files (incomplete/failed work):**
   - `movie_tracker.py` - Modified but test failed (0 movies discovered)
   - `DISCOVERY_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Incomplete test results
   - Hold these until discovery issue is fixed

2. **Runtime/cache files:**
   - `cache/*.json` - Already gitignored
   - `cache/screenshots/*.png` - Already gitignored
   - `cache/screenshots/*.html` - Already gitignored

3. **Backup files:**
   - `movie_tracking.json.backup.*` - Need to add to .gitignore first
   - `*.tmp` - Temporary files from atomic writes

4. **Log files:**
   - `logs/*.log` - Should be gitignored
   - `logs/*.log.*` - Rotated log files

5. **Data files (unless intentionally updated):**
   - `data.json` - Only commit if this is part of the admin panel work
   - `movie_tracking.json` - Only commit if schema changed

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check what would be committed
git status

# If you see unexpected files, unstage them:
git reset HEAD <filename>
```

---

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**Before running git add/commit, verify:**

- [ ] Run `git status` and review all uncommitted files
- [ ] Verify no backup files (*.backup.*) are staged
- [ ] Verify no log files (logs/*.log) are staged
- [ ] Verify no cache files (cache/*.json) are staged
- [ ] Verify .gitignore includes `logs/` and `*.backup.*`
- [ ] Check that discovery test files (movie_tracker.py, DISCOVERY_TEST_RESULTS.md) are NOT staged
- [ ] Verify admin panel is working: `python3 admin.py` and test at http://localhost:5555
- [ ] Verify no syntax errors: `python3 -m py_compile admin.py youtube_playlist_manager.py`
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets (TMDB API key should be in env/config, not code)

---

## Post-Commit Verification

**After committing but before pushing:**

```bash
# Verify commits look correct
git log --oneline -5

# Check commit details
git show HEAD
git show HEAD~1  # If you made 2 commits

# Verify no uncommitted changes remain
git status

# Check what will be pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
```

**Expected output:**
- 1-2 new commits on top of `73c6eef3`
- Commit messages match the strategy above
- `git status` shows "working tree clean" or only expected files remaining
- `git log origin/main..HEAD` shows your new commits

---

## Push Strategy

**Simple push (recommended):**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Why this works:**
- Local and remote are in sync (no merge needed)
- No conflicts possible (you're ahead, not diverged)
- Fast-forward push will succeed

**If push fails with "rejected" error:**
```bash
# Someone else pushed to origin/main since your last fetch
# Fetch and check
git fetch origin
git status

# If behind, pull with merge
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts if they arise
# Then push again
git push origin main
```

---

## Conflict Resolution (if needed)

**If `git pull` reports conflicts:**

1. **Check which files have conflicts:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Look for "both modified:" entries
   ```

2. **For each conflicted file:**
   - Open in editor
   - Look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
   - Resolve by choosing local, remote, or merging both
   - Remove conflict markers

3. **Mark as resolved:**
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```

4. **Complete the merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit  # Will use default merge commit message
   ```

5. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

**Likely conflict files (if any):**
- `DAILY_CONTEXT.md` - If automation updated it
- `data.json` - If automation ran
- `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` - If someone else added amendments

**Resolution strategy:**
- For DAILY_CONTEXT.md: Keep your version (has Oct 19-22 work)
- For data.json: Keep remote version (automation data is authoritative)
- For PROJECT_CHARTER.md: Merge both (keep all amendments)

---

## Verification on GitHub

**After pushing, verify on GitHub:**

1. **Visit repository:** https://github.com/hadrianbelove-stack/nrw-production

2. **Check commits page:**
   - Verify your commits appear at the top
   - Check commit messages are correct
   - Verify file changes are as expected

3. **Check specific files:**
   - `admin.py` - Should show inline editing, validation, logging
   - `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` - Should show AMENDMENT-045 and AMENDMENT-046
   - `diary/` - Should have 2025-10-17.md, 2025-10-19.md, 2025-10-20.md

4. **Check Actions tab:**
   - Verify daily automation workflow still runs
   - Check for any workflow failures

5. **Test deployment:**
   - If you have a deployment, verify it picks up the changes
   - Test admin panel functionality in deployed environment

---

## Rollback Plan (if something goes wrong)

**If you need to undo the push:**

```bash
# Revert to previous commit (before your changes)
git reset --hard 73c6eef3

# Force push (DANGEROUS - only if you're sure)
git push --force origin main
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** Force push rewrites history. Only use if:
- You're the only developer
- No one else has pulled your commits
- You're absolutely sure you want to discard the commits

**Safer alternative - Revert commits:**
```bash
# Create new commits that undo your changes
git revert HEAD~1..HEAD

# Push the revert commits
git push origin main
```

This preserves history and is safer for collaboration.

---

## Special Considerations

### 1. Discovery Test Files

**Status:** Test failed (0 movies discovered), root cause unknown

**Recommendation:** DO NOT commit these files yet:
- `movie_tracker.py` (if modified)
- `DISCOVERY_TEST_RESULTS.md`

**Why:** Committing failed experiments pollutes git history. Fix the discovery issue first, then commit the working solution.

**How to exclude:**
```bash
# If accidentally staged, unstage:
git reset HEAD movie_tracker.py DISCOVERY_TEST_RESULTS.md
```

### 2. Template Refactoring Files

**If template refactoring was completed:**
- `admin/templates/index.html`
- `admin/static/css/admin.css`
- `admin/static/js/admin.js`

**These SHOULD be committed** as part of Commit 1.

**If template refactoring was NOT completed:**
- Don't commit these files
- `admin.py` still has embedded template (lines 38-1397)
- Template refactoring can be done in a future session

**How to check:**
```bash
ls -la admin/templates/index.html admin/static/css/admin.css admin/static/js/admin.js
# If files exist, include them in commit
```

### 3. Backup Files

**Check for backup files:**
```bash
ls -la movie_tracking.json.backup.*
ls -la *.tmp
```

**If they exist:**
1. Add to .gitignore:
   ```
   *.backup.*
   *.tmp
   ```
2. Verify they're not staged:
   ```bash
   git status | grep backup
   ```
3. If staged, unstage:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD *.backup.* *.tmp
   ```

### 4. Log Files

**Check for log files:**
```bash
ls -la logs/
```

**If they exist:**
1. Verify .gitignore has `logs/` entry
2. Verify they're not staged:
   ```bash
   git status | grep logs
   ```
3. If staged, unstage:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD logs/
   ```

---

## Summary: Step-by-Step Execution

**Execute in this order:**

1. **Check current state:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git status --porcelain
   ```

2. **Review uncommitted files** - Compare with "Expected Uncommitted Files" section above

3. **Exclude unwanted files:**
   - Unstage discovery test files (if staged)
   - Verify backup/log files are gitignored
   - Verify cache files are gitignored

4. **Stage files for Commit 1 (code changes):**
   ```bash
   git add admin.py youtube_playlist_manager.py config.yaml
   git add cache/.gitkeep cache/screenshots/.gitkeep
   # If template refactoring completed:
   git add admin/templates/ admin/static/ .gitignore
   ```

5. **Create Commit 1:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Admin panel redesign: QA database editor with inline editing

   [Use full commit message from Option A above]"
   ```

6. **Stage files for Commit 2 (documentation):**
   ```bash
   git add PROJECT_CHARTER.md DAILY_CONTEXT.md
   git add diary/2025-10-17.md diary/2025-10-19.md diary/2025-10-20.md
   git add AGENT_SCRAPER_DIAGNOSTICS.md AGENT_SCRAPER_FUTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   git add VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
   ```

7. **Create Commit 2:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Docs: Admin panel QA architecture + agent scraper resolution

   [Use full commit message from Option A above]"
   ```

8. **Verify commits:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   git status  # Should show clean or only discovery test files
   ```

9. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

10. **Verify on GitHub:**
    - Visit https://github.com/hadrianbelove-stack/nrw-production/commits/main
    - Verify both commits appear
    - Check file changes are correct

---

## What to Do Next (After Push)

1. **Update DAILY_CONTEXT.md** for next session:
   - Run `./ops/archive_daily_context.sh` to create diary/2025-10-22.md
   - Document the git commit and push work
   - Note that discovery test files are uncommitted (intentionally)

2. **Fix discovery issue:**
   - Investigate why movie_tracker.py found 0 movies
   - Add debug output to see TMDB API responses
   - Test with broader date ranges
   - Compare with generate_data.py (which added 15 movies via automation)

3. **Test admin panel in production:**
   - Verify all features work after deployment
   - Test inline editing, validation, YouTube playlists
   - Monitor logs for errors

4. **Monitor automation:**
   - Check that daily automation still runs correctly
   - Verify data.json updates daily
   - Check for any workflow failures
