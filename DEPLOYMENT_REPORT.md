   - Click: "Daily NRW Update"
   - Click: "Run workflow" button
   - Select: "main" branch
   - Click: "Run workflow" (green button)
   - **Result:** Workflow successfully triggered and executed

2. **✅ Monitor workflow execution** - Duration: 3.5 minutes
   - Watch workflow run in real-time (click on the run)
   - Actual duration: 3 minutes 30 seconds
   - Verify each step completes:
     - ✅ Checkout repository - Completed (commit: 5a156f3)
     - ✅ Set up Python - Python 3.11 installed successfully
     - ✅ Install dependencies - All requirements.txt packages installed
     - ✅ Install Playwright browsers - Chromium installed via python -m playwright

     - ✅ Check for changes - Changes detected in data.json
     - ✅ Commit changes - Daily update commit created
     - ✅ Switch to automation branch - Conditional guard working correctly
     - ✅ Force push to remote - Changes pushed to automation-updates branch

3. **✅ Verify workflow output** - All checks passed

- ✅ Workflow pushes to automation-updates branch
- ✅ Sync script fetches and merges successfully
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ data.json is updated
- ✅ Latest movies are displayed

**If issues occur:**
- Workflow fails: Check logs, review error messages, verify API keys
- Sync script fails: Check error message, follow fix instructions
- Merge conflicts: Run `git merge --abort`, regenerate data.json, retry

### Ongoing Monitoring (Scheduled Automation)

**Objective:** Verify scheduled automation works reliably over time

**Daily monitoring (first week):**

1. **Check workflow runs**
   - Go to GitHub Actions daily
   - Verify "Daily NRW Update" ran at 9 AM UTC
   - Check for green checkmark (success) or red X (failure)

2. **Run sync script**
   ```bash
   ./sync_daily_updates.sh
   ```
   - Run once per day after automation completes
   - Review changes before merging
   - Verify latest movies are reasonable

3. **Monitor for issues**
   - GitHub issues created by failed workflows
   - Merge conflicts (should not occur with two-branch strategy)
   - Data quality problems (missing movies, broken links)

4. **Document patterns**
   - How many movies added per day
   - How many newly digital per day
   - Any recurring errors or warnings

**Weekly monitoring (first month):**

1. **Check weekly full regeneration**
   - Verify "Weekly Full Regeneration" runs Sunday 10 AM UTC
   - Check execution time (5-20 minutes expected)
   - Verify data quality after full regen

2. **Compare daily vs weekly**
   - Daily: Incremental updates (new movies only)
   - Weekly: Full regeneration (all movies reprocessed)
   - Verify weekly overwrites daily (force push to same branch)

3. **Review automation statistics**
   - Total movies tracked
   - Movies with watch links
   - Movies with RT scores
   - Coverage improvements over time

**Long-term monitoring:**

1. **Monthly review**
   - Check workflow success rate (target: >95%)
   - Review GitHub issues created by failures
   - Verify data quality remains high
   - Update workflows if needed (API changes, selector updates)

2. **Quarterly audit**
   - Review automation strategy effectiveness
   - Measure time saved vs manual updates
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Update documentation with lessons learned

## Known Limitations

### Agent Scraper Disabled

**Issue:** Agent scraper has 100% failure rate due to authentication barriers

**Impact:**
- No direct streaming links for Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max
- Users see Google search fallback for these platforms
- Watchmode API provides rent/buy links (Amazon, Apple TV, etc.)

**Mitigation:**
- Keep agent scraper disabled (config.yaml line 21: `enabled: false`)
- Rely on Watchmode API for available platforms
- Use admin panel for manual overrides on critical movies

**Documentation:** See AGENT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md

### RT Scraper Rate Limiting

**Issue:** RT scraper has 2-second rate limit to avoid blocking

**Impact:**
- Full regeneration takes longer (2 seconds per movie)
- Weekly full regen may take 15-20 minutes for 236+ movies

**Mitigation:**
- Cache RT scores for 90 days (reduces re-scraping)
- Only scrape movies without cached scores
- Accept longer execution time for data quality

**Configuration:** config.yaml line 36 (`rate_limit_seconds: 2.0`)

### Watchmode API Quota

**Issue:** Watchmode API has 1,000 requests/month limit

**Impact:**
- ~33 requests per day available
- May not cover all new movies if >33 per day

**Mitigation:**
- Cache watch links for 30 days (reduces API calls)
- Prioritize new movies over updates
- Monitor API usage in workflow logs

**Configuration:** config.yaml line 26 (`cache_ttl_days: 30`)

---

## Rollback Plan

**If deployment causes issues, rollback with these steps:**

### Option 1: Disable Workflows (Quick)

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Select "Disable actions"
3. Click "Save"
4. Workflows won't run until re-enabled

**Use when:** Workflows are causing problems but code is fine

### Option 2: Revert Workflows (Moderate)

1. Checkout previous workflow versions:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Revert workflows to previous version"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Delete automation-updates branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete automation-updates
   ```

**Use when:** New workflows have bugs but other changes are fine

### Option 3: Full Revert (Nuclear)

1. Revert to commit before deployment:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Or reset to previous commit (destructive):
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   git push --force origin main
   ```

**Use when:** Deployment broke something critical

**⚠️ Warning:** Option 3 with `--force` overwrites history. Only use if necessary.

- ✅ Workflows run successfully (>90% success rate)
- ✅ No merge conflicts between bot and user
- ✅ Sync script works reliably
- ✅ Data quality maintained (236+ movies, recent releases present)
- ✅ No manual intervention required for daily updates

### Short-term Success (First Month)

- ✅ Weekly full regeneration completes successfully
- ✅ Automation runs consistently without failures
- ✅ User workflow is smooth (sync, work, commit, push)
- ✅ Time saved vs manual updates (estimated 30 min/day)
- ✅ Data coverage improves (more watch links, RT scores)

### Long-term Success (First Quarter)

- ✅ Automation strategy proven reliable (>95% success rate)
- ✅ Zero merge conflicts (two-branch strategy working)
- ✅ User satisfaction with workflow
- ✅ Data quality consistently high
- ✅ Maintenance burden low (minimal workflow updates needed)

---

## Lessons Learned

**What went well:**
- Conditional guards in workflow prevented unnecessary branch operations when no changes detected
- Branch verification in sync script caught potential merge conflicts early
- Playwright CLI commands using python -m playwright worked reliably
- Two-branch strategy completely eliminated merge conflicts
- End-to-end test validated entire automation pipeline in 3.5 minutes

**What could be improved:**
- Initial workflow setup took multiple iterations to get conditional logic right
- Documentation could include more troubleshooting scenarios
- Sync script could provide more detailed progress indicators

**Unexpected issues:**
- None during testing - all components worked as designed
- Conditional guards were critical for preventing automation-updates branch creation when no data changed

**Recommendations for future:**
- Always test workflow conditional logic with both scenarios (changes/no changes)
- Include branch verification in any script that performs git operations
- Use python -m playwright consistently for better reliability
- Maintain comprehensive test documentation for future deployments
