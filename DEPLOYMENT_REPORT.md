## Testing Plan

### Immediate Testing (Manual Trigger)

**Objective:** Verify the complete workflow before relying on scheduled automation

**Steps:**

1. **Trigger workflow manually**
   - Go to: https://github.com/hadrianbelove-stack/nrw-production/actions
   - Click: "Daily NRW Update"
   - Click: "Run workflow" button
   - Select: "main" branch
   - Click: "Run workflow" (green button)

2. **Monitor workflow execution**
   - Watch workflow run in real-time (click on the run)
   - Expected duration: 3-5 minutes
   - Verify each step completes:
     - ✅ Checkout repository
     - ✅ Set up Python
     - ✅ Install dependencies
     - ✅ Install Playwright browsers
     - ✅ Configure Git
     - ✅ Run daily pipeline
     - ✅ Check for changes
     - ✅ Commit changes (if any)
     - ✅ Switch to automation branch
     - ✅ Force push to remote

3. **Verify workflow output**
   - Check workflow logs for errors
   - Verify it pushed to automation-updates branch
   - Check automation-updates branch on GitHub:
     - Should have new commit: "Daily update - [date] [automated]"
     - Should show changes to data.json

4. **Run sync script locally**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/hadrianbelove/Downloads/nrw-production
   ./sync_daily_updates.sh
   ```

5. **Verify sync script output**
   - Shows changes from automation (git diff --stat)
   - Shows commit message from bot
   - Merges successfully
   - Displays latest movies added
   - Creates merge commit

6. **Verify local repository state**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Expected:
   - Merge commit: "Sync automation updates - [date]"
   - Automation commit: "Daily update - [date] [automated]"
   - Previous commits

7. **Verify data.json updated**
   ```bash
   git show HEAD:data.json | jq '.generated_at'
   ```
   Expected: Recent timestamp

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Workflow completes without errors
- ✅ Workflow pushes to automation-updates branch
- ✅ Sync script fetches and merges successfully
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ data.json is updated
- ✅ Latest movies are displayed

**If issues occur:**
- Workflow fails: Check logs, review error messages, verify API keys
- Sync script fails: Check error message, follow fix instructions
- Merge conflicts: Run `git merge --abort`, regenerate data.json, retry

### Ongoing Monitoring (Scheduled Automation)

**Objective:** Verify scheduled automation works reliably over time

**Daily monitoring (first week):**

1. **Check workflow runs**
   - Go to GitHub Actions daily
   - Verify "Daily NRW Update" ran at 9 AM UTC
   - Check for green checkmark (success) or red X (failure)

2. **Run sync script**
   ```bash
   ./sync_daily_updates.sh
   ```
   - Run once per day after automation completes
   - Review changes before merging
   - Verify latest movies are reasonable

3. **Monitor for issues**
   - GitHub issues created by failed workflows
   - Merge conflicts (should not occur with two-branch strategy)
   - Data quality problems (missing movies, broken links)

4. **Document patterns**
   - How many movies added per day
   - How many newly digital per day
   - Any recurring errors or warnings

**Weekly monitoring (first month):**

1. **Check weekly full regeneration**
   - Verify "Weekly Full Regeneration" runs Sunday 10 AM UTC
   - Check execution time (5-20 minutes expected)
   - Verify data quality after full regen

2. **Compare daily vs weekly**
   - Daily: Incremental updates (new movies only)
   - Weekly: Full regeneration (all movies reprocessed)
   - Verify weekly overwrites daily (force push to same branch)

3. **Review automation statistics**
   - Total movies tracked
   - Movies with watch links
   - Movies with RT scores
   - Coverage improvements over time

**Long-term monitoring:**

1. **Monthly review**
   - Check workflow success rate (target: >95%)
   - Review GitHub issues created by failures
   - Verify data quality remains high
   - Update workflows if needed (API changes, selector updates)

2. **Quarterly audit**
   - Review automation strategy effectiveness
   - Measure time saved vs manual updates
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Update documentation with lessons learned

## Known Limitations

### Agent Scraper Disabled

**Issue:** Agent scraper has 100% failure rate due to authentication barriers

**Impact:**
- No direct streaming links for Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max
- Users see Google search fallback for these platforms
- Watchmode API provides rent/buy links (Amazon, Apple TV, etc.)

**Mitigation:**
- Keep agent scraper disabled (config.yaml line 21: `enabled: false`)
- Rely on Watchmode API for available platforms
- Use admin panel for manual overrides on critical movies

**Documentation:** See AGENT_SCRAPER_TEST_REPORT.md

### RT Scraper Rate Limiting

**Issue:** RT scraper has 2-second rate limit to avoid blocking

**Impact:**
- Full regeneration takes longer (2 seconds per movie)
- Weekly full regen may take 15-20 minutes for 236+ movies

**Mitigation:**
- Cache RT scores for 90 days (reduces re-scraping)
- Only scrape movies without cached scores
- Accept longer execution time for data quality

**Configuration:** config.yaml line 36 (`rate_limit_seconds: 2.0`)

### Watchmode API Quota

**Issue:** Watchmode API has 1,000 requests/month limit

**Impact:**
- ~33 requests per day available
- May not cover all new movies if >33 per day

**Mitigation:**
- Cache watch links for 30 days (reduces API calls)
- Prioritize new movies over updates
- Monitor API usage in workflow logs

**Configuration:** config.yaml line 26 (`cache_ttl_days: 30`)

---

## Rollback Plan

**If deployment causes issues, rollback with these steps:**

### Option 1: Disable Workflows (Quick)

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Select "Disable actions"
3. Click "Save"
4. Workflows won't run until re-enabled

**Use when:** Workflows are causing problems but code is fine

### Option 2: Revert Workflows (Moderate)

1. Checkout previous workflow versions:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Revert workflows to previous version"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Delete automation-updates branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete automation-updates
   ```

**Use when:** New workflows have bugs but other changes are fine

### Option 3: Full Revert (Nuclear)

1. Revert to commit before deployment:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Or reset to previous commit (destructive):
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   git push --force origin main
   ```

**Use when:** Deployment broke something critical

**⚠️ Warning:** Option 3 with `--force` overwrites history. Only use if necessary.
