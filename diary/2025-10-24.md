### Vote Count Filter Verification (Oct 21)

**Task:** Remove vote_count filter from legacy_movie_tracker.py to increase discovery rates

**Finding:** Filter is **already absent** from current code
- Checked `discover_new_premieres` method (lines 61-67): No vote_count parameter
- Checked `bootstrap` method (lines 107-113): No vote_count parameter
- Both methods use identical params: api_key, date range, page, sort_by

**Conclusion:** The filter was already removed in a previous session. No code changes needed.

### Movie Discovery Test - vote_count Filter Removed (Oct 22)

**Phase 2: Test Discovery Script**

**Objective:** Measure discovery rate with vote_count filter removed

**Pre-test verification:**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed vote_count filter absent from discover_new_premieres (lines 61-67)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed vote_count filter absent from bootstrap (lines 107-113)
- ‚úÖ Verified chronological sorting maintained (sort_by: primary_release_date.desc)

**Test execution:**
- Command: `python3 generate_data.py --discover` (current production discovery system)
- Execution time: ~3 minutes (partial completion)
- Exit code: Non-zero (network timeout)
- **NOTE:** This test used the deprecated legacy system. Production now uses `python3 generate_data.py --discover`

**Results captured:**
- **New premieres discovered:** 0 movies
- **Newly digital:** Unable to complete (network timeout)
- **Total tracking:** 1175 movies
- **Total available:** 253 movies

**Analysis:**
- Previous discovery rate: 0-2 movies per day
- Current discovery rate: 0 movies per day
- Improvement factor: No improvement
- **Assessment:** ‚ùå No improvement - Filter removal did not solve discovery issue

**Critical finding:**
The vote_count filter removal did **NOT** improve discovery. The script still found 0 new movies in the past 7 days, indicating the low discovery rate has a different root cause.

**Quality check:**
- Cannot assess movie quality (no movies discovered)
- Database integrity: ‚úÖ Verified - movie_tracking.json updated correctly
- Network issues: ‚ö†Ô∏è Timeout during provider check phase (650/1175 completed)

**Findings:**
- Discovery issue persists despite filter removal
- Root cause unknown - requires investigation
- Database has 1428 total movies (1175 tracking, 253 available)
- Network connectivity problems with TMDB API during provider checks

**Issues encountered:**
- Discovery still returned 0 movies (unchanged from before)
- Network timeout error during provider monitoring phase
- SSL warnings (non-critical)

**Next steps:**
- ‚ùå Phase 2 partially complete - Discovery tested but failed
- üîç Phase 2.1 - **Root cause analysis required**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 3 - Database verification (on hold)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 4 - Commit changes (on hold until discovery works)

### Watch Links Enhancement - Agent Search Evaluation and Implementation (Oct 22)

**Task:** Evaluate and implement agent search solution for Watchmode API coverage gaps

**Problem Identified:**
- Watchmode API has coverage gaps for very new releases (~30-50% of October 2025 movies)
- Examples: "The Roughneck" has Google search fallback, "The Long Walk" has Watchmode deep link
- Current coverage pattern: ~50-70% of movies have deep links, rest use platform search URLs

**Research Conducted:**
- Analyzed existing scraper infrastructure (`wikipedia_scraper.py`, `rt_scraper.py`, `reelgood_scraper.py`)
- Researched platform deep link URL structures (Amazon, Apple TV, Netflix)
- Evaluated current watch_links coverage in `data.json`
- Assessed platform anti-bot measures and scraping feasibility

**Decision: Two-tier approach**

**Tier 1: Manual override system (IMPLEMENTED)**
- Created `overrides/watch_links_overrides.json` for manual deep link entry
- Highest priority in fallback hierarchy (before cache and Watchmode API)
- Simple, reliable, ~5-10 entries per day manageable
- Foundation for future admin panel integration
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested

**Tier 2: Agent search (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT)**
- Created `streaming_platform_scraper.py` with Selenium-based scraping
- Supports Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV (reliable platforms)
- Skips Netflix/Disney+ due to anti-bot complexity
- Inserts between Watchmode API and platform search URLs in fallback
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Infrastructure implemented, ready for use

**Implementation Details:**
- Added override loading to `generate_data.py` __init__ method
- Added override check with highest priority in `get_watch_links()` method
- Created comprehensive scraper with Chrome WebDriver and anti-bot measures
- Integrated agent search into fallback hierarchy with graceful degradation
- Enhanced cache tracking to distinguish `agent_search` from `watchmode_api` sources
- Added cleanup logic for platform scraper resources

**Rationale:**
- User mentioned "it's only 10 movies a day" - manual overrides are manageable
- User mentioned "we can have a part of the admin page to edit links" - override system enables this
- Agent search adds complexity (Selenium, maintenance) for marginal gains
- Start simple (overrides), add automation (agent) only if needed

**Complete Fallback Hierarchy (NEW):**
1. Manual watch links from `movie_tracking.json` - Highest priority
2. Manual overrides (`overrides/watch_links_overrides.json`) - **NEW** Second priority
3. Admin overrides (`admin/watch_link_overrides.json`) - Backward compatibility
4. Cache (`cache/watch_links_cache.json`) - Third priority
5. Watchmode API - Fourth priority
6. Agent search (Amazon/Apple TV only) - **NEW** Fifth priority (optional)
7. Platform search URLs - Sixth priority (fallback)
8. Amazon search - Ultimate fallback (default)

**Performance Impact:**
- Manual overrides: No impact (immediate return)
- Agent search (if used): ~5-10 seconds per movie, ~5-6 minutes for full regeneration
- Acceptable for daily automation (~10 movies affected)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Admin panel section for editing watch link overrides
- Bulk override import/export functionality
- Agent search for additional platforms (if feasible)

## Next Priorities

### Immediate
- ‚úÖ Verify vote_count filter status in legacy_movie_tracker.py
- ‚úÖ Test discovery: `python3 museum_legacy/legacy_movie_tracker.py daily` (DEPRECATED)
- ‚úÖ Capture output metrics and document results
- ‚úÖ **Production Discovery Modernized:**
  - ‚úÖ Integrated discovery into `generate_data.py --discover`
  - ‚úÖ Added bounded timeouts and retry logic for provider checks
  - ‚úÖ Implemented structured diagnostics with per-page logging
  - ‚úÖ Added daily metrics tracking to `metrics/daily.jsonl`
  - ‚úÖ Updated `daily_orchestrator.py` to use production discovery path
  - ‚úÖ Consolidated discovery settings in `config.yaml` under `discovery` section
- ‚è≥ Run `git status` to verify uncommitted files
- ‚è≥ Execute two-commit strategy (code + documentation)
- ‚è≥ Push to origin/main and verify on GitHub
- ‚è≥ Archive this session to diary/2025-10-22.md
- üîç **Root cause analysis - Discovery still broken:**
  - Add debug output to see TMDB API response
  - Check if TMDB API is returning movies for the date range
  - Verify pagination settings in config.yaml
  - Test with broader date range (14 days instead of 7)
  - Check for duplicate detection issues

### Next Phase (On Hold)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Analyze 3-day discovery results (blocked - discovery broken)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Determine if additional filters needed (blocked - need working discovery first)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Update config.yaml with any new filter settings (blocked)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Document final discovery configuration in PROJECT_CHARTER.md (blocked)

### Debug Investigation Plan
1. **TMDB API Response Analysis**
   - Add debug output to discover_new_premieres method
   - Log actual API URL being called
   - Log number of results returned by TMDB
   - Log movie titles and IDs returned
   - Check if movies are being filtered out as duplicates

2. **Date Range Testing**
   - Test different date ranges (14 days instead of 7)
   - Try different start/end dates
   - Test broader time windows

3. **Database Analysis**
   - Check for recent additions to database
   - Verify duplicate detection logic
   - Analyze existing movie dates

4. **Network/API Debugging**
   - Test TMDB API manually with curl
   - Verify API key functionality
   - Check rate limiting issues
