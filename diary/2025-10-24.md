## AI Assistant Quick Start

**READ THESE FILES FIRST WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:**

1. **This file (DAILY_CONTEXT.md)** - Current state, recent changes, active issues
2. **[PROJECT_CHARTER.md](PROJECT_CHARTER.md)** - Governance rules, amendments, API keys, architectural decisions
3. **[NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md](NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md)** - Data pipeline mechanics, how everything fits together

**What is this rolling context system?**

This is a **living document** that gets overwritten each session with current information. At the end of each session, we archive it to  (immutable historical record). This approach:
- **Avoids token waste** from loading months of PROJECT_LOG.md history
- **Provides fresh context** without stale information
- **Maintains audit trail** in the diary/ folder
- **Reduces AI confusion** by keeping focus on current state

See [AMENDMENT-036](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-036-rolling-daily-context) and [AMENDMENT-037](PROJECT_CHARTER.md#amendment-037-daily-context-system-three-file-loading-pattern) for governance rules.

## What We Did Today (2025-10-24)

### 2025-10-24 - Watch Links Validation Test INVALID (Configuration Error)

**Status:** 🔴 Test Failed - Configuration Error

**Root Cause:**
TMDB API key was missing from config.yaml (line 22 commented out) and no environment variable was set. The script crashed on line 179 of generate_data.py during initialization, before any Watchmode API calls were made.

**Invalid Test Results:**
- ❌ Watchmode API coverage: 0% (MISLEADING - never tested due to crash)
- ❌ Final coverage: 46.6% (INVALID - based on incomplete test)
- ❌ Manual overrides needed: 132 movies (INVALID - artificially high)

**Valid Test Results:**
- ✅ Amazon scraper success rate: 100% (266 deep links generated)
- ✅ Average search time: ~10.8 seconds per movie
- ✅ Selectors working perfectly (no anti-bot detection)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Add TMDB API key to config.yaml (line 23): `tmdb_api_key: "99b122ce7fa3e9065d7b7dc6e660772d"`
2. Delete invalid test_results.txt file
3. Re-run validation test: `python3 generate_data.py --full > test_results.txt 2>&1`
4. Extract real Watchmode API statistics from console output
5. Update documentation with accurate results

**Expected Results After Fix:**
- Watchmode API: 60-80% success rate (typical for free tier)
- Amazon scraper: 100% success rate (already validated)
- Final coverage: 85-90% (meeting target)
- Manual overrides needed: 10-20 movies (not 132)

**Key Lesson:**
- Always verify test environment configuration before interpreting results
- Script crashes during initialization invalidate all reported statistics
- Amazon scraper is working excellently (100% success rate confirmed)

**Next Actions:**
1. ✅ Fix config.yaml (add TMDB API key)
2. ⏳ Re-run validation test
3. ⏳ Update IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md with real results
4. ⏳ Update README.md watch links status tables
5. ⏳ Update this entry with corrected test results

**Files Updated:**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Added test invalidation notice and re-test checklist
- `README.md` - Updated status tables to show test invalid
- `config.yaml` - Added TMDB API key (pending)
- `DAILY_CONTEXT.md` - This corrected entry

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### CRITICAL-003: Watch Links Validation - Configuration Error (2025-10-24)

**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - Test invalid due to missing TMDB API key

**Impact:** Cannot assess Watchmode API performance or final watch links coverage

**Blocker:** TMDB API key not configured in config.yaml or environment variable

**Resolution:** Add TMDB API key to config.yaml (line 23) and re-run test

**Timeline:** 5 minutes to fix configuration + 10 minutes to re-run test

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks production readiness assessment

## Quick Reference

### Unified Launcher (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive menu for all tools
./launch_all.sh

Menu options:
  1) 🎬 Public Site (port 8000/8001)
  2) 🔧 Admin Panel (port 5555) - Auth required
  3) 📺 YouTube Playlist Manager (CLI)
  4) 🚀 All Services (site + admin)
  5) ❌ Exit

Tip: Option 4 is best for daily work (launches site + admin)
```

### Daily Workflow
🎬 NEW RELEASE WALL - Daily Startup
====================================

🔍 Step 0: Checking dependencies...
   ✅ All dependencies available

📥 Step 1: Pulling latest data from automation...
   ✅ Data is current

📊 Step 2: Quick Status Report
   Total movies on wall: 247
   Tracked: 1808 / Displayed: 247
   New today (Oct 23): 0
   New yesterday (Oct 22): 5
   Last generated: 2025-10-23T17:33:38

📋 Step 3: Context Files for AI Assistants
   When working with AI assistants, read these files in order:
   1. DAILY_CONTEXT.md (current state, recent changes, active issues) ⭐ PRIMARY
   2. PROJECT_CHARTER.md (governance & amendments)
   3. NRW_DATA_WORKFLOW_EXPLAINED.md (technical pipeline)

🚀 Step 4: Starting local server...
   ⚠️ Port 8000 in use, trying 8001...
   ❌ Ports 8000 and 8001 both in use. Stop other servers first.
   Try: lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill

### Daily Operations (Direct Commands)

(Or use `./launch_all.sh` for menu-driven interface)

```bash
./launch_NRW.sh              # Public site
python3 admin.py             # Admin panel
python3 generate_data.py     # Regenerate data
```

### Manual Pipeline (if needed)
❌ DEPRECATED: movie_tracker.py is no longer supported

The movie tracking functionality has been integrated into the production discovery system.
Please use the following commands instead:

  For daily discovery:
    python3 generate_data.py --discover

  For full data generation:
    python3 generate_data.py

  For the complete daily pipeline:
    python3 daily_orchestrator.py

The legacy implementation is available at:
    museum_legacy/legacy_movie_tracker.py

For more information, see README.md and DAILY_CONTEXT.md

### Admin Panel - Post-Publication Curation

```bash
# Quick launch via menu
./launch_all.sh  # Select option 2 or 4

# Or direct launch
python3 admin.py  # http://localhost:5555
```

Daily curation workflow:
  1. Sync automation updates: ./sync_daily_updates.sh
  2. Open admin panel (see above)
  3. Review new movies, hide/feature as needed
  4. Fix missing data (⚠️ Missing Data filter)
  5. Regenerate data.json (🔄 button)

Key concept: Movies are VISIBLE BY DEFAULT
  - Automation discovers → Movies appear on site
  - Admin curates AFTER publication (not before)
  - Use 🚫 Hide button to remove unwanted movies
  - Use ⭐ Feature button to highlight important releases

For detailed workflow: See ADMIN_WORKFLOW.md
