description: Start site (3000) and admin (5556) servers
---

Run the unified launcher script:

```bash
./launch_all.sh
```

This handles everything automatically:
- Kills stale processes
- Verifies servers respond before reporting success
- Opens browsers
- Ctrl+C stops both cleanly

DO NOT manually start servers with `python3 -m http.server` or `python3 admin.py`. Always use the script.
